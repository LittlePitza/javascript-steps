// Arrays in JavaScript are used to store a collection of items (elements) in a single variable.
// These items can be of any type, including numbers, strings, objects, and even other arrays.
// Arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is accessed with index 0.

//let exampleArray = [1, "hello", true, [2, 3], { key: "value" }];
//console.log(exampleArray[0]); // Accessing the first element
//console.log(exampleArray.length); // Getting the number of elements in the array

let colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow", "purple"];
console.log(colors[1]);
